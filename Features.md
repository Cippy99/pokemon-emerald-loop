Here's a list of all the changes made from base Emerald.

## Story

- Team Aqua and Magma leaders have different teams, determied at the start of the game.

- Birch bag will now contain 3 random starters from gen 1 to 8, one for each type.

- Added a move tutor in Verdanturf Town that teaches powerful moves for shards. Shards can be founs trough Hoenn, and can be bought at the Pokèmon League's Pokèmon Center.

- The Treasure Hunter on route 124 has now open a shop that sells evolutionary stones instead of trading them for shards.

- Implemented a portable PC that can be used from everywhere (Except at the Pokèmon League). It will be given to you from a Devon Corp guy. It can also be used to quickly heal your party.

- Mt. Pyre can't be entered until you have obtained the 6th Gym Badge.

## Map

- New grass areas on Route 105, Route 107, Route 127, Rute 132, Route 133 and Oldale Town.

- Added a new location: Glacial Hollow. It can be found on route 103 and it's house to many ice type Pokèmon.

- Mt. Pyre has been splitted between interior and exterior, so that in nuzlockes there will be two different encounters.

## Battle

- Gen 9 Battle Mechanics.

- Trainer parties have been changed so that they feel distinct.

- You can choose 3 differenty difficulty settings at the start of the game.
    - Level caps for major fights. Once your Pokèmon is at the level cap, it can no longer gain experience until after the fight (Only in normal and hard difficulty)
    - Items cannot be used in battle (Only in hard mode)

- Learnset are based for the most part on their gen 7 counterpart (Or gen 8 if they didn't exist in gen 7).

- Some weaker Pokèmon had their BST, abilities and moveset modified in order to be more viable.

- Wild Pokèmon can have their hidden ability. The probability is 20% if they have 3 abilities and 30% otherwise. Some species had their hidden ability swapped with a normal one.
