## What is Pokèmon Emerald Loop?

Pokèmon Emerald Loop is a rom hack of Pokèmon Emerald based on the [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project and enhanced by the pokeemerald [expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) by the ROM Hacking Hideout communty.

## What is this hack?

All features can be found here, but the main one are the following:
### Reworked Gym Leaders and Elite 4 System

The main challenge of every pokemon game is to obtain all the 8 Gym Badges, defeat the Elite 4 and become the capion of the region. However, playng the same game multiple times make this fights very repetitive. To avoid these, in Pokèmon Emerald Loop every Gym and E4 room is home of a different Type Expert, choosen randomly at the start of the game. In version 1.0 there will be one type expert per type, for a total of 18, but I plan to keep updating tha game and have 4 expert per type in the final verison, for a grand total of 72!

### Complete Documentation

### Updated Battle Mechanics

### New QoL Imrovements

## Is this hack complete?

Pokèmon Emerald Loop is still in development.
