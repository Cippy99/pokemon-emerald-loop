# Pokèmon Emerald Loop
## What is Pokèmon Emerald Loop?

Pokèmon Emerald Loop is a rom hack of Pokèmon Emerald based on the [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project and enhanced by the pokeemerald [expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) by the ROM Hacking Hideout communty.

## What is this hack?

All features can be found here, but the main one are the following:
### Reworked Gym Leaders and Elite 4 System

The main challenge of every pokemon game is to obtain all the 8 Gym Badges, defeat the Elite 4 and become the champion of the region. However, playing the same game multiple times make this fights very repetitive. To avoid this, in Pokèmon Emerald Loop every Gym and E4 room is home of a different Type Expert, choosen randomly at the start of the game. In version 1.0 there will be one type expert per type, for a total of 18, but I plan to keep updating tha game and have 4 expert per type in the final verison, for a grand total of 72!

The champion is also random and can be one of the champions of different regions.

Team Magma and Aqua Admin also have different teams choosen at the start of the game.

### New Difficulty Options

### Complete Documentation

Pokèmon Emerald Loop is developed with the idea that everything about the game should be documented, from trainer parties to items and wild encounters. For this reason I created a [wiki](https://github.com/Cippy99/pokemon-emerald-loop/wiki) that contains all the necessary information.

For nuzlocke enthusiast, I also plan to create a damage calculator for this hack.

### Updated Battle Mechanics

Pokèmon Emerald Loop has pokemon from the first 8 generations and uses gen 9 Battle Mechanics. The main difference from vanilla Emerld are:
- Physical / Special split
- Introduced Fairy type and updated type effectiveness chart (Steel does not resist ghost and dark)
- Crits do 50% more damage instead of double damage

For a complete list of changes see the [features](https://github.com/Cippy99/pokemon-emerald-loop/blob/master/Features.md#Battle) page.

### Balance Changes

Many changes have been made to ensure that the game feels balanced and provides a challenge that is neither too hard or too difficult. 

### New QoL Imrovements

## Is this hack complete?

Pokèmon Emerald Loop is still in development.
